# BookWorms! A Social Media App for Book Nerds~



## Learning Goals

-Set up backend in Django to learn the framework and how to support a frontend based in React using it. 


## Introduction

This app is built to bring readers together by giving them a space to share there thoughts and opinions on books they've read. It allows for users to leave reviews and share discussions in "bookclubs" they create together. 

The focus of this project was to learn about different functionality in Django while building out the frontend in a language I'm more familiar in. 




## Requirements

This app requires you to have Django and React 17.0.0

## Installation

Although I'm still developing this website, you can check it out by downloading the repo and running 'npm install'. 
You have to download the backend separately. It requires you to run the following after downloading the repo for the backend:
- python manage.py makemigrations 
- python manage.py migrate 
- python manage.py runserver
